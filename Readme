# 🔥 AI Fire Detection – Multi-Zone Industrial Monitoring

A real-time, multi-zone AI fire detection system built using **YOLOv8**, **OpenCV**, and **MQTT**, designed for **industrial monitoring and early-warning applications**.

The system allows operators to define multiple Regions of Interest (ROIs) on a live camera feed and independently monitor each zone for fire events. Each zone publishes its own **FIRE / CLEAR** status via MQTT using persistence-based logic to reduce false alarms.

> ⚠️ This project is intended for monitoring and alerting purposes only and is **not a certified fire-safety or life-critical system**.
